# Land acknowledgement

.pull-left[
**I would like to acknowledge that I work on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.**

*Traditional*: Traditionally used and/or occupied by Musqueam people

*Ancestral*: Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation

*Unceded*: Refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement

## Motivation

- Machine learning (`ML`) methods 

- Reproducible workflows and parallel computation

- Lack of CS knowledge in generic biological field

- "Advanced" data science

- **Multiomics** problem could also be viewed as mathematical or statistical problem

## Nextflow

### Data

.pull-left-narrow[

- Simulated data 

- Bulk data (.secondary[Majority])

- Single-cell data

- Spatial data
]

.pull-right-wide[
![](materials/img/omics.png)
]


Many of these data are **high dimensional**, quite abstract to illustrate in plain words.


???

Briefly explain what each consits of

Bulk -> majority of multiomics, this one ignores cell-type indenty, most basic one

Single-cell -> new single cell technologies like CITE-seq , scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and ECCITE-seq

Spaital -> Spatial distirbution of cells is known

---

## Methods

.pull-left-narrow[
.secondary[Curate multiomics data from open-source databases
]

- Collect different omics data from same samples

- AnnData for `Python`

- MultiAssayExperiment for `R`

- Normalization , batch correction
]

.pull-right-wide[
.secondary[ `Benchmarking` integrative multiomics methods
]

- Evaluate series of methods based on their tasks with classic metrics

- Compare methods on different types of multiomics data

- Develop method that improve the predictive performance and
interpretability of the results.

- Use computational power and CS parallel algorithm

]

---

## Expected Results

- Web portal app to quickly denote a method suitable to your custom data.

  .emphasis[Easily scalable to your own computing cluster]

- Availability of list of curated multiomics dataset
  
  + .secondary[Disease state]
  
  + .secondary[Number of samples/variables]
  
  + .secondary[Types of omics]
  
  + .secondary[Organ type]

---

## Expected Results

```{r data_table, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read data loaded from data-curation.R
# and source from setup chunk
DT::datatable(
  data_tab,
  fillContainer = FALSE,
  options=list(pageLength=5,scrollX=TRUE, 
               searching=FALSE)
)
```


.footnote[This is a yet to be updated data table (under curation)]

---

### Limitations and Future Direction

`r con` Collection and clean process of multiomics data

`r con` Missing source or supplementary materials from evaluated methods/papers

`r pro` Feedback to bioinformatics or general research community

`r pro` Extendable to other field that requires intensive computation

`r pro` Save time from selecting reproducible ML methods for biological problem

.emphasis[

You don't need to understand tons of cs to use this project

]

---

## Conclusion

The best performing methods on the real-world data will provide insights into why certain methods are better than others with respect predictive performance and capturing the correct underlying biological processes. 

Moreover, 

- Inform the development of a new integrative method using .hand[graph neural networks] that is applicable to different types of multiomics data.

- Highly relevant to the community utilizing multiomics data for
their research.
