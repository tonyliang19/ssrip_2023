# Land acknowledgement

.pull-left[
**I would like to acknowledge that I work on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations.**

*Traditional*: Traditionally used and/or occupied by Musqueam people

*Ancestral*: Recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation

*Unceded*: Refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement

## Motivation

- Various machine learning methods
- Parallel computation
- Lack of CS knowledge in generic biological field
- "Advanced" datascience
- Helps community to determine
